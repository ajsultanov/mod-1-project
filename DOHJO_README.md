Welcome to the D.O.H-JO, a straightforward app that makes restaurant inspection results and information easily accessible to the public, and allows users to develop and maintain profiles based on public health information.

The User Profile feature allows a user access to the health inspection data for every restaurant currently operating in New York City. They can search the database to retrieve the restaurant's latest health inspection, its inspection history, and its worst heath code violation.

The Favorites List feature allows a user to maintain a list of their favorite restaurants, ranked by the user's rating. The user's Favorites List may be updated by changing a rating, or by removing a restaurant from the list.

The Violation Code Lookup feature allows the user to view the code and description for every health code violation according to the New York City Department of Health.

The Feeling Lucky? feature delivers a random restaurant inspection
where the score was over 100, and its corresponding code violation
and description.

With Ruby, installation is easy. Simply fork and clone the repository, and run 'ruby bin/run.rb' in your terminal. Make sure to run 'bundle install' beforehand!
